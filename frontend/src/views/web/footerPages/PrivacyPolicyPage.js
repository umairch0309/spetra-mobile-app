            My Cloud Doc is committed to safeguarding the privacy and security
            of its users. We intend to provide you with personalized internet
            experience that delivers the information, resources and services
            that are most relevant and helpful to you. In order to achieve this
            goal, My Cloud Doc collects information you provide us if you
            access, voluntarily enter information into, or sign up for or
            request certain services from us on our Website.

            <br />
            The only personal information My Cloud Doc obtains about individual
            users to its website is that supplied voluntarily by users. When we
            may need personal information to provide users with customized
            content or to inform them about new features or services, users are
            explicitly asked for that information.
            <br />
            <br />
            My Cloud Doc will share your information only as described in this
            Privacy Notice, or as permitted by law. My Cloud Doc will not sell,
            lease, rent, or trade your personal information to any third party
            for that party’s marketing or promotional purposes, unless you give
            your consent.

            not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of
